# tkd-pose-detection - OLD || NEW VERSION WITH BETTER REAL-TIME DETECTION AVAILABLE ON PROFILE

## [Freedom Project Blog](https://github.com/jancarloa0524/apcsa-freedom-project)

## Current Model

The current model of tkd-pose-detection is pretty much at minimum functionality. I couldn't train it with enough data, but it still works with a bit of fidgeting. The model will improve and have more functionality in the future. [Link to Demo](https://youtu.be/uHqFf01NG-0)

## Pre-Reqs
- Use the latest version of Python; ensure pip is up to date

- **openCV must be installed on your system**

- `pip install mediapipe`

### Credits

In order to create this project, I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBQ4c1IQJSE) to learn about Python, [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/hands-on-machine-learning-with-opencv-4/) to understand Machine Learning, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG4sUNDOZFg) to understand Holistic Pose Detection, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We1uB79Ci-w) for training the Pose Detection algorithm.
